# Sorting-Algorithms-in-Java
A simple Java program that implements common sorting algorithms for sorting integer data in both ascending and descending order, while also tracking the number of swaps and comparisons for each algorithm.

Instructions:
Usage

The program expects two lines of input:

1st Line: Command Specification

[mode] [algorithm] [order]

[mode] → Specifies output type:

count → Tracks swaps and comparisons.

trace → Displays sorting steps.

[algorithm] → Sorting algorithm to use:

insert, select, bubble, heap, merge, quick, radix, bucket

[order] → Sorting order:

up → Ascending order.

down → Descending order.

2nd Line: List of Numbers

[number1] [number2] [number3] ...

A space-separated list of integers.

These numbers will be sorted based on the provided parameters.
